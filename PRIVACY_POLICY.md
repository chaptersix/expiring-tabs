# Privacy Policy for Expiring Tabs Extension

**Last Updated: August 3, 2025**

## Overview

Expiring Tabs is a Chrome extension designed to automatically manage browser tabs by closing inactive ones after a configurable time period. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Expiring Tabs is built with privacy as a core principle. We do **NOT** collect, store, or transmit:

- ❌ **Browsing history** - We cannot see which websites you visit
- ❌ **URLs or web addresses** - No access to the content of your tabs
- ❌ **Personal information** - No names, emails, or user accounts
- ❌ **Usage analytics** - No tracking of how you use the extension
- ❌ **Cookies or web data** - No access to website data
- ❌ **Network requests** - Extension works completely offline

## Information We Store Locally

The extension stores minimal data **only on your device** using Chrome's local storage:

- ✅ **Tab metadata** - Tab ID numbers, creation timestamps, and last activity times
- ✅ **User settings** - Your chosen expiration time, check frequency, and preferences
- ✅ **Basic statistics** - Count of tabs cleaned up (numbers only, no details)
- ✅ **Pinned tab status** - Whether tabs are pinned (to protect them from cleanup)

**Important:** This data never leaves your device and is automatically deleted when you uninstall the extension.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests these minimal Chrome permissions:

### Required Permissions

- **`tabs`** - Access basic tab information (creation, activation, closure) without seeing URLs or content
- **`storage`** - Save your settings and track tab activity locally on your device
- **`alarms`** - Schedule periodic cleanup checks efficiently

## Data Security

## Third-Party Services

Expiring Tabs does **NOT** use any third-party services, analytics, or external APIs. The extension operates entirely within your browser.

## Data Retention

- **Settings and statistics** are stored until you uninstall the extension
- **Tab tracking data** is automatically cleaned up when tabs are closed
