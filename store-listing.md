## Short Description (132 characters max)

Automatically close inactive tabs after a configurable time period. Keep your browser clean and improve performance.

## Detailed Description

**Keep your browser organized and boost performance with automatic tab cleanup!**

Expiring Tabs automatically closes tabs that haven't been used for a specified time period, helping you maintain a clean browsing experience without the clutter of forgotten tabs.

## ‚ú® Key Features

‚Ä¢ **Smart Auto-Cleanup** - Close tabs after 5 minutes to 1 week of inactivity
‚Ä¢ **Pinned Tab Protection** - Never accidentally close important pinned tabs
‚Ä¢ **Battery Efficient** - Uses Chrome's native alarm system for minimal resource usage
‚Ä¢ **Privacy First** - No URL tracking, no data collection, works completely offline
‚Ä¢ **One-Click Control** - Easy popup interface for quick settings
‚Ä¢ **Detailed Statistics** - Track how many tabs you've cleaned up

## üîí Privacy & Security

Unlike other tab managers, Expiring Tabs is built with privacy as a core principle:

- **No URL access** - Cannot see which websites you visit
- **No data collection** - All information stays on your device
- **Minimal permissions** - Only requests essential Chrome APIs
- **Open source** - Transparent code you can review

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Install and configure** - Set your preferred expiration time (default: 4 hours)
2. **Browse normally** - The extension tracks tab activity in the background
3. **Automatic cleanup** - Inactive tabs are closed automatically
4. **Stay organized** - Enjoy a cleaner, faster browsing experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

- **Check frequency**: How often to scan for expired tabs
- **Pinned tab protection**: Keep important tabs safe
- **Manual cleanup**: Force cleanup anytime with one click

- **Better Organization** - Focus on active tabs only
- **Reduced Clutter** - Clean, manageable browser experience
