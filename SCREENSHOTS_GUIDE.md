## Screenshot Best Practices

### Visual Design

- **Clean browser:** Hide bookmarks bar, close unnecessary UI
- **Consistent theme:** Use default Chrome theme or light theme
- **Good lighting:** Bright, clear screenshots
- **No personal info:** Don't show personal bookmarks, history, etc.

### Content Guidelines

- **Show real usage:** Use realistic tab counts and settings
- **Highlight benefits:** Make the value proposition clear
- **Professional appearance:** Clean, organized browser setup
- **Working features:** Show extension actually functioning

### Technical Tips

- **Full page screenshots:** Use Chrome DevTools Device Mode for consistent sizing
- **High DPI:** Take screenshots on high-resolution displays if possible
- **Crop carefully:** Remove unnecessary chrome, focus on extension
- **Consistent sizing:** Make all screenshots the same dimensions

## Annotation Guidelines

### What to Highlight

- Key UI elements (toggles, buttons, dropdowns)
- Important numbers (tab counts, statistics)
- User benefits (clean tabs, performance)
- Privacy features (no URL access, local storage)

### Annotation Tools

- **Arrows:** Point to important features
- **Callout boxes:** Explain key benefits
- **Highlighting:** Subtle boxes around important areas
- **Text overlays:** Brief explanatory text

### Text Guidelines

- **Keep it brief:** Short, punchy explanations
- **Focus on benefits:** What it does for the user
- **Use action words:** "Automatically cleans", "Protects pinned tabs"
- **Readable fonts:** Large, clear text that works at small sizes
